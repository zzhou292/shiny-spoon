# X-Team 39 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will design the program structure and detailed implementation (class and methods) together. In our program, there will be two classes -- student class (including info fields, add grade method, delete grade method, and get average method) and hashtable class (used to store student node). Two people will be assigned to finish each class and its inner methods. After classes has been finished, we will work on putting them together and programming Gui together.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Our team is going to make a detailed schedule, and by the due date of each assigned job, the final result must be synced to the github repository. If anyone missed a due date, we will get together in CS lab and finish the job together. We will use group message, E-mail, and online meeting softwares to keep tracking our current status as well.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will make sure to get in contact with the group and come up with a solution to the problems together.
If some one is uncimfortable with contactingthe whole group, they will at least contact the group leader.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will make sure to message the whole group 3 days in advance of the due date. This will allow us sufficient time to make sure that everything gets done before the deadlines occur.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
