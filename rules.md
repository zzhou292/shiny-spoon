# X-Team 39 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will design the program structure and detailed implementation (class and methods) together. In our program, there will be two classes -- student class (including info fields, add grade method, delete grade method, and get average method) and hashtable class (used to store student node). Two people will be assigned to finish each class and its inner methods. After classes has been finished, we will work on putting them together and programming Gui together.
